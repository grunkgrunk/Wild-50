                  At the foot of thy stones, O Sea!
                    The thoughts that arise in me!"
           (OPPOSITE: Photo of FRATER PERDURABO on his ass.)
        The number of the book is 333, as implying dis-
      persion, so as to correspond with the title, "Breaks"
        However, the "one thought is itself untrue", and
      therefore its falsifications are relatively true.
        This book therefore consists of statements as nearly
        The verse from Tennyson is inserted partly because
      of the pun on the word "break"; partly because of the
      reference to the meaning of this title page, as explained
      above; partly because it is intensely amusing for
        There is no joke or subtle meaning in the publisher's
     in 1913, Aleister Crowley's little master work, has
     long been out of print.  Its re-issue with the author's
     own Commentary gives occasion for a few notes.  We
     have so much material by Crowley himself about this
     passages which we find scattered about in the un-
       "...None the less, I could point to some solid
     achievement on the large scale, although it is com-
     posed of more or less disconnected elements.  I refer
     to THE BOOK OF LIES.  In this there are 93 chapters:
     we count as a chapter the two pages filled re-
     respectively with a note of interrogation and a mark of
     exclamation.  The other chapters contain sometimes a
     single word, more frequently from a half-dozen to
     twenty paragraphs.  The subject of each chapter is
     determined more or less definitely by the Qabalistic
     import of its number.  Thus Chapter 25 gives a revised
     ritual of the Pentagram; 72 is a rondel with the refrain
     ~Shemhamphorash', the Divine name of 72 letters;
     77 Laylah, whose name adds to that number; and
     80, the number of the letter Pe, referred to Mars, a
     panegyric upon War.  Sometimes the text is serious
     and straightforward, sometimes its obscure oracles
     demand deep knowledge of the Qabalah for inter-
     pretation, others contain obscure allusions, play
     upon words, secrets expressed in cryptogram, double
     or triple meanings which must be combined in order
     to appreciate the full flavour; others again are
     subtly ironical or cynical.  At first sight the book is a
     jumble of nonsense intended to insult the reader.  It
     requires infinite study, sympathy, intuition and
     initiation.  Given these I do not hesitate to claim that
     in none other of my writings have I given so pro-
       "...My association with Free Masonry was there-
     fore destined to be more fertile that almost any other
     study, and that in a way despite itself.  A word should
     be pertinent with regard to the question of secrecy.
     It has become difficult for me to take this matter
     very seriously.  Knowing what the secret actually is,
     mysteries.  Again, though the secret itself is of such
     tremendous import, and though it is so simple that
     I could disclose it...in a short paragraph, I might
     do so without doing much harm.  For it cannot be used
     indiscriminately...I have found in practice that the
     secret of the O.T.O. cannot be used unworthily...."
       "It is interesting in this connection to recall how it
     came into my possession.  It had occurred to me to
     these chapters bothered me.  I could not write it.  I
     invoked Dionysus with particular fervour, but still
     without success.  I went off in desperation to `change
     my luck', by doing something entirely contrary to
     my inclinations.  In the midst of my disgust, the
     spirit came over me, and I scribbled the chapter
     down by the light of a farthing dip.. When I read it
     over, I was as discontented as before, but I stuck it
     into the book in a sort of anger at myself as a
       "Shortly after publication, the O.H.O. (Outer
     Head of the O.T.O.) came to me.  (At that time I did
     not realise that there was anything in the O.T.O.
     important truths of Free Masonry.)  He said that since
     I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the
     Order, I must be allowed the IX  and obligated in
     regard to it.  I protested that I knew no such secret.
     He said `But you have printed it in the plainest
     language'.  I said that I could not have done so
     because I did not know it.  He went to the book-
     shelves; taking out a copy of THE BOOK OF LIES, he
     pointed to a passage in the despised chapter.  It
     instantly flashed upon me.  The entire symbolism not
     only of Free Masonry but of many other traditions
     blazed upon my spiritual vision.  From that moment
     the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my
     mind.  I understood that I held in my hands the key
     ably around 1921.  The student will find it very
     helpful for the light it throws on many of its passages.

            COMMENTARY (The Chapter that is not a Chapter)
       This chapter, numbered 0, corresponds to the Negative,
     which is before Kether in the Qabalistic system.

       This chapter begins by the letter O, followed by a mark of
     exclamation; its reference to the theogony of "Liber Legis" is
     explained in the note, but it also refers to KTEIS PHALLOS
     and SPERMA, and is the exclamation of wonder or ecstasy,
       (1) Silence. Nuit, O; Hadit; Ra-Hoor-Khuit, I.
                  COMMENTARY (The Ante Primal Triad)
       This is the negative Trinity; its three statements are, in an
     ultimate sense, identical. They harmonise Being, Becoming,
     Not-Being, the three possible modes of conceiving the universe.
       The statement, Nothing is Not , technically equivalent to
     Something Is, is fully explained in the essay called Berashith.
       The rest of the chapter follows the Sephirotic system of the
     Qabalah, and constitutes a sort of quintessential comment upon
       Those familiar with that system will recognise Kether,
     Chokmah, Binah, in the First Triad; Daath, in the Abyss; Chesed,
     Geburah, Tiphareth, in the Second Triad; Netzach, Hod and
     Yesod in the Third Triad, and Malkuth in the Tenth Emanation.
       It will be noticed that this cosmogony is very complete; the
     manifestation even of God does not appear until Tiphareth; and
       The chapter many therefore be considered as the most complete
       (2) The Unbroken, absorbing all, is called Darkness.
                O! the heart of N.O.X. the Night of Pan.

                To beget is to die; to die is to beget.
                Cast the Seed into the Field of Night.
       The shape of the figure I suggests the Phallus; this
     chapter is therefore called the Sabbath of the Goat, the
     Witches' Sabbath, in which the Phallus is adored.
       The chapter begins with a repetition of O! referred
     to in the previous chapter.  It is explained that this triad
     lives in Night, the Night of Pan, which is mystically
     called N.O.X., and this O is identified with the O in
     this word.  N is the Tarot symbol, Death; and the X
     or Cross is the sign of the Phallus.  For a fuller com-
       Nox adds to 210, which symbolises the reduction of
     duality to unity, and thence to negativity, and is thus
       The word Pan is then explained, , the letter of
     Mars, is a hieroglyph of two pillars, and therefore
     suggest duality; A, by its shape, is the pentagram,
     energy, and N, by its Tarot attribution, is death.
       Nox is then further explained, and it is shown that
     the ultimate Trinity, O!, is supported, or fed, by the
     process of death and begetting, which are the laws of
       The identity of these two is then explained.
       The Student is then charged to understand the
     spiritual importance of this physical procession in
       It is then asserted that the ultimate letter A has two
       Line 7 balances line 5.  It will be notice that the
     phraseology of these two lines is so conceived that the
       Line 8 emphasises the importance of performing

            That Mine as Thine be the Crown of the Kingdom,
            These ten words are four, the Name of the One.
       The chapter begins with a comment on Liber Legis
       Those four words, Do What Thou Wilt, are also
     identified with the four possible modes of conceiving the

     to Horus.  Compare this with the version in Chapter 44.
     There are ten sections in this prayer, and, as the prayer
     is attributed to Horus, they are called four, as above
     explained; but it is only the name of Horus which is
       This may be compared with the Qabalistic doctrine
     of the Ten Sephiroth as an expression of Tetra-
       It is now seen that this Hawk is not Solar, but
     Mercurial; hence the words, the Cry of the Hawk, the
     essential part of Mercury being his Voice; and the
     number of the chapter, B, which is Beth the letter of
     weapons, and it must be remembered that this card is
     numbered 1, again connecting all these symbols with

       Gimel is the High Priestess of the Tarot.  This
     chapter gives the initiated feminine point of view; it is
     therefore called the Oyster, a symbol of the Yoni.  In
     Equinox X, The Temple of Solomon the King, it is
     explained how Masters of the Temple, or Brothers of
     A.'.A.'. have changed the formula of their progress.
     These two formulae, Solve et Coagula, are now ex-
     plained, and the universe is exhibited as the interplay
     between these two.  This also explains the statement in

     Be thou the Bride; thou shalt be the Mother here-

     This child shall be the heir of Fate the Father.
       Daleth is the Empress of the Tarot, the letter of
     Venus, and the title, Peaches, again refers to the Yoni.
       The chapter is a counsel to accept all impressions;
     it is the formula of the Scarlet woman; but no impression
     must be allowed to dominate you, only to fructify you;
     just as the artist, seeing an object, does not worship it,
     but breeds a masterpiece from it.  This process is
     exhibited as one aspect of the Great Work.  The last
     two paragraphs may have some reference to the 13th

       In line 3, the Logos is declared as the Negative.
       Line 4 is another phrasing of the familiar Hindu
     statement, that that which can be thought is not true.
       In line 5, we come to an important statement, an
     adumbration of the most daring thesis in this book-
     Father and Son are not really two, but one; their unity
     being the Holy Ghost, the semen; the human form is a
       So far the chapter has followed the Sephiroth from
     Kether to Chesed, and Chesed is united to the Supernal
     Triad by virtue of its Phallic nature; for not only is
     Amoun a Phallic God, and Jupiter the Father of All,
     but 4 is Daleth, Venus, and Chesed refers to water,
     from which Venus sprang, and which is the symbol of
     the Mother in the Tetragrammaton.  See Chapter 0,
     "God the Father and Mother is concealed in genera-
       But Chesed, in the lower sense, is conjoined to

     and lesser countenances, whereas Daath is the false.

     they have attained.  If it were not so, they would be
     called "six" in its bad sense of mere intellect.

     in its highest sense, down to Tiphareth; it is the new
       Chaos and Babalon are Chokmah and Binah, but
     they are really one; the essential unity of the supernal

       I may add a further comment on the number 91.
     13 (1 plus 3) is a higher form of 4.  4 is Amoun, the
     God of generation, and 13 is 1, the Phallic unity.
     Daleth is the Yoni.  And 91 is AMN (Amen), a form
     of the Phallus made complete through the intervention
     of the Yoni.  This again connects with the IO and OI

     how he was able to win at the game of guessing odd or
     even.  (See Poe's tale of "The Purloined Letter".)
     But this is a more serious piece of psychology.  In one's
     advance towards a comprehension of the universe, one
     changes radically one's point of view; nearly always it
       this is the cause of most religious controversies.
     Paragraph 1, however, is Frater Perdurabo's formula-
     tion of his perception of the Universal Joke, also
     described in Chapter 34.  All individual existence is
     tragic.  Perception of this fact is the essence of comedy.
     "Household Gods" is an attempt to write pure comedy.
       At the end of the chapter it is, however, seen that to
     the Master of the Temple the opposite perception occurs
     simultaneously, and that he himself is beyond both of

       This chapter is quite clear, but one my remark in
     the last paragraph a reference to the nature of Samadhi.
       As man loses his personality in physical love, so
     does the magician annihilate his divine personality in
       The formula of Samadhi is the same, from the
     lowest to the highest.  The Rosy-Cross is the Universal
     Key.  But, as one proceeds, the Cross becomes greater,
     until it is the Ace, the Rose, until it is the Word.
     Death implies change and individuality if thou be

     The bird of individuality is ecstasy; so also is its
     In love the individuality is slain; who loves not love?
     Love death therefore, and long eagerly for it.
       This seems a comment on the previous chapter; the
     Stag-Beetle is a reference the Kheph-ra, the Egyptian
     God of Midnight, who bears the Sun through the
     Underworld; but it is called the Stag-Beetle to emphasise
     his horns.  Horns are the universal hieroglyph of energy,
       The 16th key of the Tarot is "The Blasted Tower".
     In this chapter death is regarded as a form of marriage.
     Modern Greek peasants, in many cases, cling to Pagan
     belief, and suppose that in death they are united to the
     Deity which they have cultivated during life.  This is "a
     consummation devoutly to be wished" (Shakespeare).
       In the last paragraph the Master urges his pupils to

     French "tourbillion", whirlwind, the false Ego or dust-devil.
       True life, the life, which has no consciousness of "I", is said to
     be choked by this false ego, or rather by the thoughts which its
     explosions produce.  In paragraph 4 this is expanded to a

     it is because such sacrifices come under the Great Law

     to express his discontent.  Hence such absurdities as

     the like.  Similarly we find people asserting today that
     woman is superior to man, and that all men are born
       The Master (in technical language, the Magus) does
     not concern himself with facts; he does not care whether
     a thing is true or not: he uses truth and falsehood in-

       The chapter heading, the Waratah, is a voluptuous scarlet
     flower, common in Australia, and this connects the chapter
     with Chapters 28 and 29; but this is only an allusion, for
     the subject of the chapter is OUR LADY BABALON,
     who is conceived as the feminine counterpart of IT.

     "lion-serpent" to the sigil of his ascending decan. (Teth=

       Paragraph 7 explains the theological difficulty referred
     to above.  There is only one symbol, but this symbol has
     many names: of those names BABALON is the holiest.
     It is the name referred to in Liber Legis, 1, 22.
       It will be noticed that the figure, or sigil, of BABALON
     is a seal upon a ring, and this ring is upon the forefinger
     of IT.  This identifies further the symbol with itself.
       It will be noticed that this seal, except for the absence of
     a border, is the official seal of the A.'.A.'. Compare Chapter

       The Stag-beetle must not be identified with the one
     in Chapter 16.  It is a merely literary touch.
       the chapter is a resolution of the universe into
     Tetragrammaton; God the macrocosm and the micro-
     cosm beetle.  Both imagine themselves to exist; both say
     "you" and "I", and discuss their relative reality.
       The things which really exist, the things which have
     no Ego, and speak only in the third person, regard
     these as ignorant, on account of their assumption of

       This chapter should be read in connection with "The
     Soldier and the Hunchback" of which it is in some sort
       Its meaning is sufficiently clear, but in paragraphs
     6 and 7 it will be noticed that the identification of the
     Soldier with the Hunchback has reached such a pitch
     that the symbols are interchanged, enthusiasm being
     represented as the sinuous snake, scepticism as the
     Goat of the Sabbath.  In other words, a state is reached
     in which destruction is as much joy as creation.

       The paddock, being reserved for animals, represents life
     itself.  That is to say, the secret spring of life is found in the
     place of life, with the result that the horse, who represents
     ordinary animal life, becomes the divine horse Pegasus.
       In paragraph 6 we see this spring identified with the
     phallus, for it is not only a source of water, but highly
     elastic, while the reference to the seasons alludes to the well-

     this jewel being the divine spark in man, and indeed in all
     that "lives and moves and has its being".  Note this phrase,
     which is highly significant; the word "lives" excluding the
     mineral kingdom, the word "moves" the vegetable kingdom,
     and the phrase "has its being" the lower animals, including
       This "toad" and "jewel" are further identified with the
     Lotus and jewel of the well-known Buddhist phrase and
     this seems to suggest that this "toad" is the Yoni; the
     suggestion is further strengthened by the concluding phrase
     in brackets, "Keep us from evil", since, although it is the
     place of life, the means of grace, it may be ruinous.

       Paragraphs 1-3 repeat the familiar arguments
       Paragraph 4 alludes to Liber Legis I, 52; "place"
     implies space; denies homogeneity to space; but when
     "place" is perfected by "t"-as it were, Yoni by Lingam
     -we get the word "placet", meaning "it pleases".

     necessary to separate things, in order that they might
     rejoice in uniting.  See Liber Legis I, 28-30, which is

     chosen, and carefully trained to fulfill the sacrament of
     fatherhood; the shame of sex consists in the usurpation
     of its function by the unworthy.  Sex is a sacrament.

 himself the Mahalingam, which unites these symbolisms.  The opening of the eye,
 the ejaculation of the lingam, the destruction of the universe, the accomplishm

 referred to in the note; for the eye of Horus (see 777, Col.

 either a credit or a debit, you are still in account with the universe.

       The chapter alludes to Levi's drawing of the Hexa-
     gram, and is a criticism of, or improvement upon, it.
     In the ordinary Hexagram, the Hexagram of nature,
     the red triangle is upwards, like fire, and the blue
     triangle downwards, like water.  In the magical hexa-
     gram this is revered; the descending red triangle is
     that of Horus, a sign specially revealed by him per-
     sonally, at the Equinox of the Gods.  (It is the flame
     desending upon the altar, and licking up the burnt
     offering.)  The blue triangle represents the aspiration,
     since blue is the colour of devotion, and the triangle,
     kinetically considered, is the symbol of directed force.
       In the first three paragraphs this formation of the
     hexagram is explained; it is a symbol of the mutual
     separation of the Holy Guardian Angel and his client.

       The title is due to the circumstances of the early
     refreshed by hearing the anthems in this chief of the
       May find one thing of all those things the same!
       There are three consecutive verses in the Pentateuch,
     each containing 72 letters.  If these be written beneath
     each other, the middle verse bring reversed, i.e. as in
     English, and divisions are then made vertically, 72
     tri-lateral names are formed, the sum of which is
     Tetragrammaton; this is the great and mysterious
     Divided Name; by adding the terminations Yod He,
     or Aleph Lamed, the names of 72 Angels are formed.
     The Hebrews say that by uttering this Name the
     universe is destroyed.  This statement means the same
     as that of the Hindus, that the effective utterance of
     the name of Shiva would cause him to awake, and so
       In Egyptian and Gnostic magick we meet with pylons
     and Aeons, which only open on the utterance of the

     white is destroyed, it leaves black; yet black exists.  So
     that in that case at least one known phenomenon of this

   The Hebrew letter Gimel adds up to 73; it means a camel.
   The title of the chapter is borrowed from the well-known lines of Rudyard
        "But the commissariat camel, when all is said and done,
         'E's a devil and an awstridge and an orphan-child in one."
   Paragraph 1 may imply a dogma of death as the highest form of initiation.
 Initiation is not a simple phenomenon.  Any given initiation must take place
 on several planes, and is not always conferred on all of these simultaneously.
 Intellectual and moral perception of truth often, one might almost say usually,
 precedes spiritual and physical perceptions.  One would be foolish to claim
 initiation unless it were complete on every plane.
   Paragraph 2 will easily be understood by those who have practised
 Asana.  there is perhaps a sardonic reference to rigor mortis, and certainly
 one conceives the half-humorous attitude of the expert towards the beginner.
   Paragraph 3 is a comment in the same tone of rough good nature.  The word
 Zelator is used because the Zelator of the A.'.A.'. has to pass an examination
 in Asana before he becomes eligible for the grade of Practicus.  The ten days
 allude merely to the tradition about the camel, that he can go ten days without
   Paragraph 4 identifies the reward of initiation with death; it is a cessation
 of all that we call life, in a way in which what we call death is not.  3, silv

     expressing thought in writing; it seems, on the face of
     it, absurd that the the text of this book, composed as it is
     of English, simple, austere, and terse, should need a
     commentary.  But it does so, or my most gifted Chela
     and myself would hardly have been at the pains to
     write one.  It was in response to the impassioned appeals
     of many most worthy brethren that we have yielded up

   But all this is again only a glamour of Maya, as previously observed in the
 text (Chapter 31).  All this is true and false, and it is true and false to say
   The prose of this chapter combines, and of course denies, all these meanings,
 both singly and in combination.  It is intended to stimulate thought to the
 point where it explodes with violence and for ever.
   A study of this chapter is probably the best short cut to Nibbana.
   The thought of the Master in this chapter is exceptionally lofty.
   That this is the true meaning, or rather use, of this chapter, is evident fro

 themselves worthless animals (without the epithets), carry the Charioteer in th

 silence which results when they are all done with.
   The word "neigh" is a pun on "nay", which refers to the negative conception
 already postulated as beyond IT.  The suggestion is, that there may be somethin
 falsely described as silence, to represent absence-of-conception beyond that

 criticism of metaphysics as such, and this is doubtless one of its many sub-

       Now, the Devil of the Tarot is the Phallus, the Redeemer,
     and Laylah symbolises redemption to Frater P.  The
     number 77, also, interpreted as in the title, is the redeeming
       The ratio of the length of title and text is the key to the
     true meaning of the chapter, which is, that Redemption is
     really as simple as it appears complex, that the names (or
     veils) of truth are obscure and many, the Truth itself plain
     and one; but that the latter must be reached through the
     former.  This chapter is therefore an apology, were one
     needed, for the Book of Lies itself.  In these few simple
     words, it explains the necessity of the book, and offers it-
     humbly, yet with confidence-as a means of redemption to

     and effect.  Thence, to discover the cause behind all
     causes. Success in this practice qualifies for the grade

       The Buddhist analysis may be true, but not for

     its ecstasies are only transitory, is contemptible.
       Paragraph 5.  Coote is a blackmailer exposed by The
     Equinox.  The end of the paragraph refers to Catullus,
     his famous epigram about the youth who turned his
     uncle into Harpocrates.  It is a subtle way for Frater P.
     to insist upon his virility, since otherwise he could not

       Frater P. continues the subject of Chapter 79.
       He pictures himself as a vigorous, reckless, almost
     rowdy Irishman.  he is no thin-lipped prude, to seek
     salvation in unmanly self-abnegation; no Creeping
     Jesus, to slink through existence to the tune of the Dead
     March in Saul; no Cremerian Callus to warehouse his

     disheartens modern thinkers, as a good enough reason for

     of the Haymarket, in Chicago.  See Frank Harris,
       Paragraph 1 explains that Frater P. sees no use
     in the employment of such feeble implements as bombs.
     Nor does he agree even with the aim of the Anarchists,
     since, although Anarchists themselves need no restraint,
     not daring to drink cocoa, lest their animal passions
     should be aroused (as Olivia Haddon assures my
     favourite Chela), yet policemen, unless most severely
       The last bitter sentence is terribly true; the personal
     liberty of the Russian is immensely greater than that of
     the Englishman.  The latest Radical devices for
     securing freedom have turned nine out of ten English-
     men into Slaves, obliged to report their movements to
     the government like so many ticket-of-leave men.
       The only solution of the Social Problem is the

     What oath may stand the shock of this offence:
       Of baffled birth, in death still lurks a change;
       And all the leopards in thy woods that range,

       The subject of the chapter is consequently corollary
     to Chapters 79 and 80, the ethics of Adept life.

     interpreting, refining away, analysing.  Be simple and

     further danger, and the warning becomes superfluous.
     How much more then should He devote Himself to
       AIWASS for the understanding of the Holy Books
     Yet must he labour underground eternally.  The
       sun is not for him, nor the flowers, nor the voices
       of the birds; for he is past beyond all these.  Yea,
       verily, oft-times he is weary; it is well that the
       weight of the Karma of the Infinite is with him.
     Therefore is he glad indeed; for he hath finished THE
       WORK; and the reward concerneth him no whit.
       The title refers to the mental attitude of the Master;
     the avalanche does not fall because it is tired of staying
     on the mountain, or in order to crush the Alps below it,
     or because that it feels that it needs exercise.  Perfectly
     unconscious, perfectly indifferent, it obeys the laws of

     H. the interpenetrating Spirit, without and within.
     Fierce are the Fires of the Universe, and on their
       daggers they hold aloft the bleeding heart of earth.
     Upon the earth lies water, sensuous and sleepy.
     Above the water hangs air; and above air, but also
       below fire-and in all-the fabric of all being
   The number 86 refers to Elohim, the name of the elemental
   The title is the Sanskrit for That, in its sense of "The Existing".
   This chapter is an attempt to replace Elohim by a more
   The best attribution of Elohim is Aleph, Air; Lamed, Earth;
 He, Spirit; Yod, Fire; Mem, Water.  But the order is not good;
 Lamed is not satisfactory for Earth, and Yod too spiritualised a

 Nihil is taken to affirm that the universe is Nothing, and that is
 now to be analysed.  The order of the element is that of Jeheshua.
 The elements are taken rather as in Nature; N is easily Fire,
 since Mars is the ruler of Scorpio: the virginity of I suits Air
 and Water, elements which in Magick are closely interwoven:
 H, the letter of of breath, is suitable for Spirit; Abrahadabra is
 called the name of Spirit, because it is cheth: L is Earth, green
 and fertile, because Venus, the greenness, fertility, and earthiness
   In paragraph 7 we turn to the so-called Jetziratic attribution
 of Pentagrammaton, that followed by Dr. Dee, and by the Hindus,
 Tibetans, Chinese and Japanese.  Fire is the Foundation, the
 central core, of things; above this forms a crust, tormented
 from below, and upon this condenses the original steam. Around this
 flows the air, created by Earth and Water through the action of

 for another analysis of the elements; but after a different manner.

     It is the unification of all symbols and all planes.
